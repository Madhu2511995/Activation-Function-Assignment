    "1. **Sigmoid Function (Logistic):** \n",
    "#### σ(x)= 1/(1+e**-x) \n",
    "\n",
    "   - It squashes the input values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems. However, it can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, hindering learning in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperbolic Tangent Function (tanh):** \n",

    "3. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** \n",
    "#### ReLU(x)=max(0,x)\n",
    "   - Widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. It replaces negative values with zero, introducing non-linearity. However, it can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem where neurons become inactive during training.\n",

    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Their impact is significant and can affect aspects such as convergence speed, model expressiveness, and the ability to capture complex patterns. Here are some key ways in which activation functions influence neural network training and performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Linearity and Model Expressiveness:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network. This non-linearity is essential for the network to learn and approximate complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Without activation functions, the entire neural network would behave like a linear model, limiting its capacity to represent intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:**\n",
    "   - During backpropagation, gradients are calculated and used to update the weights of the network. Activation functions influence the flow of gradients backward through the network. Some activation functions, like sigmoid and tanh, are prone to the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through many layers. This can hinder the training of deep networks. ReLU and its variants (e.g., Leaky ReLU) help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Dead Neurons:**\n",
    "   - In the case of ReLU activation, neurons can sometimes become inactive (dead neurons) during training, as they always output zero for negative inputs. This is known as the \"dying ReLU\" problem. Leaky ReLU and other variants address this issue by allowing a small, non-zero gradient for negative values, ensuring that neurons can continue to learn even for negative inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence Speed:**\n",
    "   - The choice of activation function can affect the convergence speed of the training process. Some activation functions converge faster than others for certain types of problems. ReLU, for example, often leads to faster convergence compared to sigmoid or tanh, as it allows positive gradients to flow directly without any saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Suitability for Task:**\n",
    "   - Different activation functions may be more suitable for specific tasks. For example, sigmoid and softmax functions are commonly used in the output layer for binary and multi-class classification, respectively. The choice of activation functions should align with the nature of the task and the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Activation functions also impact the computational efficiency of the network. Some functions, like ReLU, are computationally more efficient than others, which can be important, especially in large-scale models and applications with resource constraints.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### σ(x)= 1/(1+e**-x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the sigmoid activation function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:** The sigmoid function squashes its input values to the range [0, 1]. As \\(x\\) approaches positive infinity, σ(x) approaches 1, and as \\(x\\) approaches negative infinity, σ(x) approaches 0. This property makes it useful in binary classification problems, where the output can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smoothness:** The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable everywhere, which is beneficial for gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation. This allows for efficient learning during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Interpretation:** The output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. In binary classification tasks, a threshold (commonly 0.5) is often used to make a final class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of the Sigmoid Activation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Squashing Property:** The sigmoid function is useful when you want to ensure that the output of a neuron is between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Differentiability:** The sigmoid function is differentiable everywhere, facilitating the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of the Sigmoid Activation Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient:** One major disadvantage of the sigmoid function is the vanishing gradient problem. During backpropagation, as the network learns through multiple layers, the gradients can become extremely small, leading to slow or stalled learning. This can be particularly problematic in deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Saturation:** The sigmoid function saturates when its input is far from zero, meaning that the function becomes flat, and the gradient approaches zero. This saturation can slow down the learning process, especially during the initial phases of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Zero-Centered:** The sigmoid function is not zero-centered, which can be suboptimal for weight updates during backpropagation. This can lead to zigzagging in weight updates and slow convergence.\n",

    "Here are some key characteristics and differences between ReLU and the sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:** While the sigmoid function squashes its input values to the range [0, 1], ReLU allows positive values to pass through unchanged and sets negative values to zero. As a result, the range of ReLU is [0, +∞).\n",

    "2. **Non-Saturation:** Unlike the sigmoid function, ReLU does not suffer from saturation for positive input values. Saturation refers to situations where the output of the activation function becomes flat, leading to vanishing gradients during backpropagation. ReLU's non-saturation property helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and accelerates the convergence of neural networks.\n",

    "Using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function over the sigmoid function in neural networks offers several benefits, particularly in the context of training deep neural networks. Here are some of the key advantages of ReLU over the sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Saturation and Addressing Vanishing Gradient:**\n",
    "   - ReLU does not suffer from the saturation problem that the sigmoid function encounters. Saturation refers to the flattening of the activation function for extreme input values, leading to vanishing gradients during backpropagation. The non-saturation property of ReLU helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, enabling more effective learning in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Faster Convergence:**\n",
    "   - ReLU often leads to faster convergence during training. The lack of saturation for positive input values means that the neurons can learn more quickly and adapt to the input data, especially in the initial phases of training. This contributes to faster learning and model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - ReLU is computationally more efficient compared to the sigmoid function. The ReLU activation involves a simple thresholding operation, making it faster to compute. This efficiency is particularly advantageous in large-scale neural networks and deep learning architectures, where computational resources are a consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse Activation:**\n",
    "   - ReLU tends to produce sparse activation, meaning that only a subset of neurons are activated for a given input. This sparsity can be beneficial in terms of computational efficiency and model interpretability. It also allows the network to focus on relevant features and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Zero-Centered (Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU):**\n",
    "   - While the standard ReLU is not zero-centered, which can pose challenges during optimization, variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU introduce a small slope for negative values. This helps mitigate issues related to not being zero-centered and improves optimization dynamics.\n",

    "2. **Mitigating the \"Dying ReLU\" Problem:**\n",
    "   - The \"dying ReLU\" problem refers to the issue where neurons can become permanently inactive during training because they always output zero for negative inputs. Leaky ReLU mitigates this problem by allowing a small, continuous flow of information through neurons with negative inputs, ensuring that they can still contribute to the learning process.\n",
